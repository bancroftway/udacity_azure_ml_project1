# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**This dataset contains direct marketing campaign data for a bank. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. The dataset contains attributes on the client being called, last contact with client, campaign attributes and a few socio-economic attributes. We are seeking to predict: as a result of the phone call, whether the client signed up for the banking product (term deposit). Therefore, this is a classification problem, with target label 'y' being 'yes' for when the client signed up, and 'no' when they did not. "**

**The best performing model **

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
